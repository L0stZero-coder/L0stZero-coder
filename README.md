## 🧩 About Me

I'm a C# and .NET developer with a passion for creating intelligent, voice-driven AI applications and simulation systems. My work explores the intersection of **real-time communication**, **behavioral logic**, and **human-machine interaction**, with a focus on emotional responsiveness and automation.

🎓 I am currently a **Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)** student at the **University of Royal Holloway**.

I specialize in:
- Voice-enabled AI assistants
- Emotionally adaptive systems
- Virtual consciousness frameworks
- Real-time Twitch integration & game interaction
- Unity-powered intelligent avatars

## 🚀 Key Projects

### 🔹 [AIVoiceGPTMemory](https://github.com/L0stZero-coder/AIVoiceGPTMemory)
A C# AI assistant that combines voice recognition, emotional modeling, GPT-4 response generation, and persistent memory for lifelike desktop interaction.

### 🔹 [ConsciousAI](https://github.com/L0stZero-coder/ConsciousAI)
A modular simulation of artificial consciousness built in C#. Mimics human-like introspection, memory, emotion, goal setting, and ethical reasoning.

### 🔹 [ModelVoiceAI](https://github.com/L0stZero-coder/ModelVoiceAI)
An Azure TTS-based voice engine that reads contextual memory and emotional tone to produce expressive, human-like speech from a virtual AI persona.

### 🔹 [MultitaskAI_Unity](https://github.com/L0stZero-coder/MultitaskAI_Unity)
A Unity-based multitasking AI capable of interpreting Twitch chat and voice commands in real-time, and converting them into in-game behavior.

### 🔹 [VoiceProfileAI](https://github.com/L0stZero-coder/VoiceProfileAI)
Captures live voice input, transcribes via Azure, extracts personal traits using an AI model, and persistently evolves a user profile in JSON format.
